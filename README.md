# Sorting Algorithms - C++

Command-line based Sorting Algorithms to enhance and develop sorting algorithms skills and knowledge. Learning goals were to create sorting algorithms to minimise the space and time complexity used. The program contains `Counting`, `Insertion`, `Merge`, `Random Quick` and `Selection` sort.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* The program was executed and developed on `Windows 10 - Visual Studio Code`. The program was executed on the `Visual Studio Code - Integrated Terminal`.
* Should be executable on any OS and machine.
* The program utilises the official C++ included libraries of `algorithm` and `vector`.

### Installing

* Clone or download the project on your local machine.
* C++ version 11 required.

### Executing program

* The file to execute the game is `SortingAlgorithms.exe`.
* The program utilised a single optional command-line argument among `InsertionSort`, `MergeSort`, `RandQuickSort` and `SelectionSort` to select the sorting algorithm. By default, the `Counting Sort` is set.
* Use the following terminal command if `g++` installed:
```
g++ SortingAlgorithms.cpp -o SortingAlgorithms && SortingAlgorithms <ARGUMENT>
```
